      "The cuts include 34 immediate layoffs, the closing of dozens of open positions and reductions made this summer in response to the elimination of federal funding for education programming.\n",

The organization previously said it was cutting its budget by 21 percent and reducing dues for its member stations.\n",
      "NPR is also reducing its budget to provide some stations with relief. Katherine Maher, NPR’s chief executive, told Texas Public Radio that the organization was cutting its overall budget by $8 million, a “first step” to navigating the crisis.\n",
      "The brunt of the financial crisis is landing on local stations across the United States, many of which rely heavily on federal funding. Dozens of TV and radio stations are in danger of shutting down, and many are applying for grant funding to stay afloat.\n"

      "Congress voted this year to strip $500 million in annual funding from public broadcasters, including PBS stations.\n",
      "PBS, which has its headquarters in Arlington, Va., said it was cutting 100 positions, including 34 immediate layoffs.\n",
      "Credit...\n",
      "PBS is cutting 100 positions, or roughly 15 percent of its staff, as a result of the major federal funding cuts to public broadcasting.\n",
      "Paula Kerger, the chief executive of PBS, said in an email to station managers on Thursday that the staff reductions were a last resort. The organization had already frozen hiring, restricted travel and paused pay increases.\n",
      "The cuts include 34 immediate layoffs, the closing of dozens of open positions and reductions made this summer in response to the elimination of federal funding for education programming.\n",
      "“These decisions, while difficult, position PBS to weather the current challenges facing public media,” Ms. Kerger said in her email.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like every public media organization in the United States, PBS is facing serious financial challenges after Congress’ elimination of $500 million in annual federal funding in July. The organization previously said it was cutting its budget by 21 percent and reducing dues for its member stations.\n",
      "NPR is also reducing its budget to provide some stations with relief. Katherine Maher, NPR’s chief executive, told Texas Public Radio that the organization was cutting its overall budget by $8 million, a “first step” to navigating the crisis.\n",
      "The brunt of the financial crisis is landing on local stations across the United States, many of which rely heavily on federal funding. Dozens of TV and radio stations are in danger of shutting down, and many are applying for grant funding to stay afloat.\n",
